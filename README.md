# Single-Trait-Punnett-Square-Calculator

This is a simple Punnet Square Calculator it not only serves as a visual guide for mendelian inheritance but also provides possible genotypic and phenotypic frequencies for a particular offspring, given the know genotypes of its parents.

Remember to only use capital (A) for dominant alleles and lower case (a) for recessive alleles.

Have fun!
